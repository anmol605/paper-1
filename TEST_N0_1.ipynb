        "1) What is Python, and why is it popular ?\n",
        "   Python is a versatile, high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readability and ease of use. It's popular due to its simple syntax, extensive libraries, and adaptability to various fields like web development, data science, and machine learning.\n",
        "   It is popular for High-level, Interpreted,Versatile,\n",
        "   Open-source,Simple syntax.\n",
        "\n",
        "2) What is an interpreter in Python ?\n",
        "  In Python, an interpreter is a program that reads and executes Python code line by line, without requiring it to be compiled into machine code beforehand. It translates each high-level statement into lower-level instructions that the computer can understand and run.  \n",
        "\n",
        "3) What are pre-defined keywords in Python ?\n",
        "  Keywords in Python are reserved words that have predefined meanings and cannot be used as identifiers (variable names, function names, etc.). They are essential for the language's syntax and structure.  \n",
        "\n",
        "4) Can keywords be used as variable names ?\n",
        "  No, keywords cannot be used as variable names in programming languages like C, C++, Python, and Java. Keywords have specific, predefined meanings within the language and are used for syntax and structure. Using them as variable names would lead to ambiguity and errors because the compiler/interpreter would not know if you're referring to a variable or a keyword.\n",
        "\n",
        "5) What is mutability in Python ?\n",
        "  In Python, mutability refers to an object's ability to be modified after its creation. Mutable objects can be changed without creating a new object. This means that their state or content can be altered directly.\n",
        "\n",
        "6) Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable ?\n",
        " Lists are mutable, meaning that their contents can be changed after the list has been created. You can add, remove, or modify elements within a list.\n",
        " Tuples are immutable, meaning once a tuple is created, its contents cannot be changed. You cannot add, remove, or modify elements in a tuple.   \n",
        "\n",
        "7)  What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python ?\n",
        " ### `==` Operator\n",
        "- **Purpose**: The `==` operator checks for **value equality**. It determines whether the values of two objects are the same, regardless of whether they are the same object in memory.\n",
        "- **Behavior**: When you use `==`, Python calls the `__eq__()` method of the objects being compared, which can be overridden to provide custom equality logic.\n",
        "### `is` Operator\n",
        "- **Purpose**: The `is` operator checks for **identity equality**. It determines whether two references point to the same object in memory.\n",
        "- **Behavior**: When you use `is`, Python checks if the two operands refer to the exact same object (i.e., they have the same memory address).\n",
        "\n",
        "8) What are logical operators in Python ?\n",
        "   In Python, logical operators are used to combine conditional statements and evaluate boolean expressions. There are three main logical operators in Python:\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. `and`\n",
        "- **Description**: The `and` operator returns `True` if both operands (conditions) are `True`. If either operand is `False`, it returns `False.\n",
        "\n",
        "9) What is type casting in Python ?\n",
        "   ype casting in Python is the process of converting a variable from one data type to another. This is useful when you need to perform operations on data types that require specific types or when you want to ensure that different types can be compared or manipulated together.\n",
        "\n",
        "10) What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting ?\n",
        "    \n",
        "    implicit Type Casting (Automatic Type Conversion)\n",
        "    1. **Definition**: Implicit type casting, also known as automatic type conversion, occurs when Python automatically converts one data type to another without any explicit instruction from the programmer.\n",
        "\n",
        "    2. **When It Happens**:\n",
        "   - This typically occurs during arithmetic operations or when combining different data types, where a more \"general\" type is needed to accommodate the operation.\n",
        "   - For example, when an integer and a float are used in an operation, the integer is automatically converted to a float to avoid data loss.\n",
        "   \n",
        "   Explicit Type Casting (Manual Type Conversion)\n",
        "\n",
        "    1. **Definition**: Explicit type casting, also known as manual type conversion, requires the programmer to specify the type conversion using built-in functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "    2. **When It Happens**:\n",
        "   - This is used when the programmer knows that a conversion is necessary for a specific operation or to ensure that the data is in the desired format.\n",
        "\n",
        "11) What is the purpose of conditional statements in\n",
        "    Python ?\n",
        "    Conditional statements in Python allow you to control the flow of your program based on whether certain conditions are true or false. They enable decision-making and branching logic, making programs more dynamic and responsive.\n",
        "\n",
        "12) How does the elif statement work ?\n",
        "    Elif' stands for 'else if' and is used in Python programming to test multiple conditions. It is written following an if statement in Python to check an alternative condition if the first condition is false. The code block under the elif statement will be executed only if its condition is true.       \n",
        "\n",
        "13) What is the difference between for and while loops ?\n",
        "    For' and 'while' loops are two of the most fundamental iterative operations in programming. Although they share similarities, they have distinct mechanics and applications. This article explores the core differences between these two types of loops and their ideal use cases. Whether you're a novice coder or an experienced developer, comprehending these differences is essential for making informed decisions about loop usage in various programming scenarios.\n",
        "14) Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable\n",
        "    than a for loop.    \n",
        "    In programming, for loops are best used when you know the number of iterations ahead of time, whereas a while loop is best used when you don't know the number of iterations in advance. Both methods can help you iterate through your code."
